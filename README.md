The goal is to create a NFT collection for [Women of Polkadot](https://twitter.com/WomenOfPolkadot).

Currently the work is split into:
 - creating the art with different attributes, like hats, hairstyles etc. etc.
 - writing the frontend, where each individual that has there wallet address approved can come to the site, choose to modify their NFT how they like and mint it
 - smart contract has to have the ability to mint the NFTs, to trade them, list them for a certain price. Also there has to be an access list on who is allowed to mint the individual NFTs.
